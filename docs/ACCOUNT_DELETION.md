# Account Deletion Instructions

You can request the deletion of your De Woordenaar account and all associated data in two ways.

### Method 1: In-App Deletion (Recommended)

The easiest and fastest way to delete your account is directly from within the app:

1. Open De Woordenaar and log in to your account.
2. Go to the "Settings" page.
3. Tap on the "Delete Account" button.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to confirm the deletion. Your account and all your data (words, collections, progress) will be permanently deleted immediately.

### Method 2: Deletion via Email

If you no longer have access to the app, you can request account deletion by email.

- Send an email to `test.dutch.app@example.com`.
- Use the subject line: `Account Deletion Request`.
- In the body of the email, please specify the email address of the account you wish to delete.

Please note that email requests will be processed within 14 business days.
