# Data Deletion Instructions

You have full control over your data in the De Woordenaar app.

## Partial Data Deletion (Words and Collections)

You can delete parts of your data at any time directly from within the app:

- **To delete a single word:** Swipe the word in your collection and confirm the deletion.
- **To delete an entire collection:** Go to your list of collections, select the collection you wish to remove, and use the delete option.

These actions are permanent and cannot be undone.

## Full Account Deletion

You can request the permanent deletion of your entire De Woordenaar account and all associated data in two ways.

### Method 1: In-App Deletion (Recommended)

The easiest and fastest way to delete your account is directly from within the app:

1.  Open De Woordenaar and log in to your account.
2.  Go to the "Settings" page.
3.  Tap on the "Delete Account" button.
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts to confirm the deletion. Your account and all your data (words, collections, progress) will be permanently deleted immediately.

### Method 2: Deletion via Email

If you no longer have access to the app, you can request account deletion by email.

- Send an email to `test.dutch.app@gmail.com`.
- Use the subject line: `Account Deletion Request`.
- In the body of the email, please specify the email address of the account you wish to delete.

Please note that email requests will be processed within 14 business days.
