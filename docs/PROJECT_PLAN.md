# **Detailed Project Plan (Phased Approach)**

This document outlines the development of the Dutch Learning App in distinct phases, starting with a core MVP and progressively adding features.

### **Phase 0: Foundation & Architecture (The "Setup" Phase)** âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** Prepare the entire development environment and architectural foundation.

- **Project Setup:**
  - Initialize a new Expo (React Native) project with TypeScript.
  - Set up expo-router for file-based navigation.
  - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality and pre-commit hooks.
- **Supabase Integration:**
  - Set up a new Supabase project.
  - Define the database schema (as per DATABASE_SCHEMA.md).
  - Set up Row Level Security (RLS) rules: users can only access their own data.
  - Manually create a "dev" user in Supabase and get their user_id.
- **Environment:**
  - Create a .env file for storing Supabase keys and the DEV_USER_ID.
  - Set up a Supabase client in the app to connect to the backend.
- **Component Structure:**
  - Create the basic directory structure as recommended by Expo (app, components, constants, hooks, etc.).

### **Phase 1: Core MVP (The "It Works" Phase)** âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** Implement the primary user loop: add a word, see it, and review it.

- **AI Integration (Secure Backend):**
  - Create a Supabase Edge Function to securely call the Gemini API.
  - The function should accept a word, query the AI, and return structured JSON.
- **Screens & Navigation:**
  - **Home/Collections Screen:** Displays a list of word collections. Initially, it can be a single default collection.
  - **Collection Detail Screen:** Shows all the words within a selected collection.
  - **Add Word Screen:** A simple input field and a button to trigger the AI analysis flow.
  - **Review Session Screen:** A flashcard interface for reviewing words.
- **Core Functionality:**
  - **Add Word Flow:** Implement the UI to call the Edge Function, display the AI's response, and save the final word data to the Supabase database.
  - **Review Logic:**
    - Fetch words due for review (next_review_date is today or in the past).
    - Implement the Spaced Repetition System (SRS) logic based on user's self-assessment ("Again", "Hard", "Good", "Easy").
    - Implement the "relearning" queue for cards marked "Again" within the same session.
  - **Display:**
    - On the card, show only the 1-3 most common translations by default, with an option to expand and see all.

### **ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Backend Integration (COMPLETED September 7, 2025)** âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** Connect the UI to real Supabase backend and deploy full functionality.

**âœ… Completed Tasks:**

- **Authentication System:** Dev user authentication working
- **Database Integration:** All CRUD operations functional
- **AI Edge Function:** Gemini API integration fully operational
- **Testing:** Complete integration testing performed
- **Data Migration:** Mock data replaced with real backend calls

### **Phase 3: Enhancing the Learning Experience** ðŸ”„ CURRENT PHASE

**Goal:** Add more varied and engaging ways to practice vocabulary.

- **Data Migration System:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
  - **Migration Function:** Create a Supabase Edge Function for updating existing words
  - **Article Migration:** Add Dutch articles (de/het) to existing nouns in database
  - **Image Migration:** Add associated images to existing words using Unsplash API
  - **Admin Endpoint:** Create secure endpoint for running data migrations
  - **Extensible Framework:** Design system to handle future feature additions
- **New Practice Modes:**
  - **Typing Quiz:** Show the translation and ask the user to type the Dutch word.
  - **Listening Quiz:** Play the audio and ask the user to type what they hear.
- **UI/UX Improvements:**
  - Add animations and transitions using Reanimated or Skia to make the UI feel more fluid.
  - Implement loading states and skeletons for a better perceived performance.
- **Word Management:**
  - Allow users to edit or delete words from their collections.
  - Allow creating and naming multiple collections.

### **Phase 4: Gamification & Motivation**

**Goal:** Introduce elements that encourage daily use and long-term engagement.

- **Core Gamification:**
  - **Streaks:** Track consecutive days of study.
  - **Daily Goals:** Allow the user to set a goal (e.g., "review 20 words per day").
- **Visual Feedback:**
  - Create a simple dashboard or stats screen showing basic progress (total words learned, streak count, etc.).
  - Implement achievements/badges for milestones (e.g., "First 100 words learned").

### **Phase 5: Scaling & User Management**

**Goal:** Prepare the app for multiple users and add advanced features.

- **Full Authentication:**
  - Implement screens for email/password signup and login using Supabase Auth.
  - Replace the hardcoded DEV_USER_ID with the actual authenticated user's ID.
- **Advanced Settings:**
  - Create a settings screen where users can securely enter and save their own AI API key.
- **Content:**
  - Develop a system for creating and distributing pre-made word packs (e.g., "Top 100 Dutch Verbs").
- **OCR Integration:**
  - Implement a feature to take a photo or select an image.
  - Use a local or cloud-based OCR library to extract text.
  - Allow the user to tap on extracted words to add them to their collections via the AI flow.

### **Phase 6 & 7: Future Vision (The "Wow" Features)**

**Goal:** Implement unique features that set the app apart from competitors.

- **Browser Extension:** A companion extension to add words directly from websites.
- **AI-Powered Error Analysis:** Provide specific grammatical feedback on user mistakes.
- **"Word in the Wild":** Show real-world examples of learned words from recent news or articles.
- **Conversational AI Tutor:** A chat interface to practice using learned vocabulary in realistic dialogues.
