# **Detailed Project Plan (Phased Approach)**

This document outlines the development of the Dutch Learning App in distinct phases, starting with a core MVP and progressively adding features.

### **Phase 0: Foundation & Architecture (The "Setup" Phase)** ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Prepare the entire development environment and architectural foundation.

- **Project Setup:**
  - Initialize a new Expo (React Native) project with TypeScript.
  - Set up expo-router for file-based navigation.
  - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality and pre-commit hooks.
- **Supabase Integration:**
  - Set up a new Supabase project.
  - Define the database schema (as per DATABASE_SCHEMA.md).
  - Set up Row Level Security (RLS) rules: users can only access their own data.
  - Manually create a "dev" user in Supabase and get their user_id.
- **Environment:**
  - Create a .env file for storing Supabase keys and the DEV_USER_ID.
  - Set up a Supabase client in the app to connect to the backend.
- **Component Structure:**
  - Create the basic directory structure as recommended by Expo (app, components, constants, hooks, etc.).

### **Phase 1: Core MVP (The "It Works" Phase)** ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Implement the primary user loop: add a word, see it, and review it.

- **AI Integration (Secure Backend):**
  - Create a Supabase Edge Function to securely call the Gemini API.
  - The function should accept a word, query the AI, and return structured JSON.
- **Screens & Navigation:**
  - **Home/Collections Screen:** Displays a list of word collections. Initially, it can be a single default collection.
  - **Collection Detail Screen:** Shows all the words within a selected collection.
  - **Add Word Screen:** A simple input field and a button to trigger the AI analysis flow.
  - **Review Session Screen:** A flashcard interface for reviewing words.
- **Core Functionality:**
  - **Add Word Flow:** Implement the UI to call the Edge Function, display the AI's response, and save the final word data to the Supabase database.
  - **Review Logic:**
    - Fetch words due for review (next_review_date is today or in the past).
    - Implement the Spaced Repetition System (SRS) logic based on user's self-assessment ("Again", "Hard", "Good", "Easy").
    - Implement the "relearning" queue for cards marked "Again" within the same session.
  - **Display:**
    - On the card, show only the 1-3 most common translations by default, with an option to expand and see all.
