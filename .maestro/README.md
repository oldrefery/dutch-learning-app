# E2E Tests with Maestro

This directory contains end-to-end test flows for the Dutch Learning App using Maestro.

## Overview

Maestro is a modern UI testing framework that uses YAML-based test definitions. Tests are interpreted and run directly on the device/emulator without requiring compilation.

## Prerequisites

1. **Maestro CLI** installed globally:

   ```bash
   curl -Ls "https://get.maestro.sh" | bash
   ```

2. **iOS Simulator** or **Android Emulator** running

3. **App built** for testing

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

Before running tests, ensure:

1. The app is **built and running** in an emulator/simulator:

   ```bash
   npm run ios  # for iOS
   npm run android  # for Android
   ```

2. Environment variables are configured in `.env`:
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_EMAIL` - Test user email
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_PASSWORD` - Test user password

   These are automatically loaded from `.env` when running `npm run e2e:test` commands.

### Run a single test

```bash
npm run e2e:test
```

This runs the smoke test (login flow) against the app.

### Run all tests

```bash
npm run e2e:test:all
```

Runs all test flows in the `.maestro/` directory in alphabetical order.

### Record a new test

```bash
npm run e2e:record
```

Opens Maestro recording mode to create new tests interactively. Great for discovering correct selectors.

### Manual test with Maestro CLI

```bash
maestro test .maestro/01-auth-login.yaml
maestro test .maestro/ --verbose  # Run all with verbose output
```

## Test Flows

### 01-auth-login.yaml

Tests the login flow with dev user credentials loaded from environment variables.

**What it tests:**

- App launches
- Login screen is visible
- User can enter email (from `MAESTRO_TEST_EMAIL` env var)
- User can enter password (from `MAESTRO_TEST_PASSWORD` env var)
- User can tap sign in button

**Credentials:**

- Loaded from `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_EMAIL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_PASSWORD` in `.env`
- Passed to test as `${MAESTRO_TEST_EMAIL}` and `${MAESTRO_TEST_PASSWORD}`
- Never hardcoded in test files for security

### 02-auth-signup.yaml

Tests the signup flow.

**What it tests:**

- App launches
- User navigates to signup screen
- User can enter email
- User can enter password and confirm password
- User can submit signup form

### 03-app-navigation.yaml

Tests navigation between app tabs.

**What it tests:**

- App launches
- User can navigate to Review tab
- User can navigate to Add Word tab
- User can navigate to History tab
- User can navigate to Settings tab
- User can return to Home tab

## Writing New Tests

### Test Syntax

```yaml
appId: com.oldrefery.dutchlearningapp
---
# Action: Launch the app
- launchApp

# Action: Wait for animations to finish
- waitForAnimationToFinish

# Action: Assert text is visible
- assertVisible:
    text: 'Expected Text'

# Action: Tap on element by testID
- tapOn:
    id: 'test-id'

# Action: Tap on element by text
- tapOn:
    text: 'Button Text'

# Action: Input text to focused input
- inputText: 'Some text'

# Action: Scroll
- scroll:
    direction: down
    amount: 3

# Action: Take screenshot
- takeScreenshot: screenshot.png
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use testID for critical elements** - Makes tests more reliable
2. **Add wait commands** - Use `waitForAnimationToFinish` after navigation
3. **One test per flow** - Keep tests focused on a single user journey
4. **Use clear naming** - Prefix with numbers (01-, 02-) for execution order
5. **Add comments** - Explain what each test section does

### Test Credentials (Security)

Tests load credentials from environment variables to keep sensitive data out of git:

```bash
# Environment variables used by tests:
# MAESTRO_TEST_EMAIL - passed from EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_EMAIL (.env)
# MAESTRO_TEST_PASSWORD - passed from EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_PASSWORD (.env)
```

**Important:** Never hardcode credentials in test files. The npm scripts automatically:

1. Read `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_EMAIL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_PASSWORD` from `.env`
2. Pass them as `MAESTRO_TEST_EMAIL` and `MAESTRO_TEST_PASSWORD` environment variables
3. Maestro test files reference them as `${MAESTRO_TEST_EMAIL}` and `${MAESTRO_TEST_PASSWORD}`

**To use custom credentials:**

```bash
# Option 1: Update .env file (tracked locally, not in git)
EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_EMAIL=test@example.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_PASSWORD=password123

# Option 2: Pass via command line (for CI/CD)
MAESTRO_TEST_EMAIL=test@example.com MAESTRO_TEST_PASSWORD=password123 npm run e2e:test:all
```

## Adding testID to Components

To make elements testable, add `testID` prop to React Native components:

```jsx
<TouchableOpacity testID="sign-in-button">
  <Text>Sign In</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>

<TextInput testID="email-input" />
```

**Important:** All `testID` props should use kebab-case naming convention.

## CI/CD Integration

Tests can be run in CI/CD pipelines using EAS Workflows:

```yaml
# .eas/workflows/e2e-test.yml
name: e2e-tests
on: push

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
      - run: npm ci
      - run: eas build --platform android --profile e2e-test
      - run: maestro test .maestro/
```

## Troubleshooting

### "App not found" error

- Make sure the app is built and installed on the simulator/emulator
- Check that `appId` matches the app's bundle ID

### "Element not found" error

- Ensure the element has a `testID` prop
- Use Maestro Studio to inspect the app and find the correct selector
- Check that `waitForAnimationToFinish` is called before asserting visibility

### Flaky tests

- Add more `waitForAnimationToFinish` calls
- Use `assertVisible` instead of `tapOn` to wait for elements
- Increase wait times if needed
