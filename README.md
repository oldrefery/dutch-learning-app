# Dutch Learning App: Project Overview

## 1. Project Goal

To create a modern, AI-powered mobile application for learning Dutch vocabulary and phrases using the spaced repetition system (SRS). The app is designed to be a powerful and personalized learning tool, evolving from a core MVP to a feature-rich platform.

## 2. Core Philosophy

- AI-Powered: Leverage Generative AI (initially Gemini) to provide deep word analysis, context, examples, and audio, making the card creation process seamless and intelligent.

- Effective Learning: Built around a proven spaced repetition algorithm (similar to SM-2) to maximize long-term retention.

- Clean & Modern UX: A simple, intuitive, and enjoyable user interface that makes learning feel effortless.

- Scalable Architecture: Built on a modern, robust tech stack with a flexible architecture that allows for easy expansion of features in the future.

## 3. Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running locally for development.

### 1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables:

- Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill in your actual values:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

- Copy `env.local.example` to `.env.local` for local development overrides (optional):

```bash
cp env.local.example .env.local
```

- Required variables in `.env`:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_ID=your_dev_user_id_from_supabase
EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_EMAIL=dev@test.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_PASSWORD=password123
EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
```

- Optional variables in `.env.local`:

```
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_sentry_auth_token_here
```

### 4. Run the application:

```
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## 4. Key Feature in Detail: AI-Powered Word Addition

The core of the MVP is the intelligent word addition flow. Instead of manual data entry, the user leverages AI for a rich, automated experience.

### User Flow:

1. The user taps the "Add Word" button.

2. They enter a single Dutch word in any form (e.g., "gekocht").

3. The app sends this word to a secure Supabase Edge Function.

4. The function calls the Gemini AI API, requesting a full analysis: lemma (base form), part of speech, translations, and example sentences.

5. The app receives the structured data from the AI and displays it in an editable form.

6. The user can review, make minor edits if needed, and save the word to their collection. A new, comprehensive flashcard is created in seconds.

## 5. Architecture Diagram

The application uses a modern Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) architecture, which minimizes the need for a traditional, self-hosted backend.

```

### Flow Explanation:

- Direct Database/Auth: The app communicates directly with Supabase for standard operations like fetching words or authentication, secured by Row Level Security (RLS).

- Secure AI Calls: To protect the AI API key, the app never calls the AI directly. It calls a trusted Supabase Edge Function, which securely holds the key and forwards the request to the AI service.

## 6. Technology Stack

- **Platform**: React Native with Expo (for iOS, Android, and Web)
- **Navigation**: expo-router (file-based routing)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL Database, Auth, Edge Functions)
